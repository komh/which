'which' v2.1.3 for OS/2 and DOS
-------------------------------

Enhanced features in v2.1.3 (after v2.1) are:

    - Wildcard support (when compiled with emx/gcc)
    - Display date/time and size info of searched files
    - Search directories from an env variable
    - Search LIBPATH (+ BEGINLIBPATH, ENDLIBPATH), DPATH, BOOKSHELF, HELP
      directories for OS/2
    - Get the first match from all command line args (for use with makefile)
      (e.g. in GNU makefile:  CC := $(shell which -1 gcc icc) )
    - Unix or OS/2(DOS) style path conversions

This is a modified version from v2.1 of Greg Roelofs, and supports wildcards
in command names.  The wildcard support is available only when the v2.1.3
source code is compiled with emx/gcc.  Wildcard support for other compilers
is not added in this version.


Included files are:
-------------------
    src\*	    -- Modified sources (v2.1.3)
    src-org\*	    -- Original v2.1 sources
    which2.exe	    -- OS/2 executable using dll (require emxrt.zip)
    which2s.exe     -- OS/2 stand-alone executable
    whichemx.exe    -- DOS and OS/2 bound executable (require emxrt.zip)

Included *.exe are compiled with emx/gcc 0.9c fix02.  whichemx.exe can run on
either DOS or OS/2, and all these has been tested on OS/2 Warp's DOS command
window or OS/2 command window.	I hope they can run under other shells as
well.

To rebuild v2.1.3 using GNU make and emx/gcc 0.9c, run one of the following
in src\ dir:

    make gccdyn     -- to create executable that uses dll
    make gcc	    -- stand-alone executable
    make emx	    -- OS/2 + DOS bound executable


Installation:
-------------

Copy an executable to 'which.exe' and place it in a PATH.


Using which:
------------

For more information, refer to the original documentations in src-org\.

    v2.1.3  June 3, 1997
	- Option -l now searches BEGINLIBPATH + LIBPATH + ENDLIBPATH.
	    (Thanks to "Bruce A. Mallett" <bam@NightStorm.com>)
	- New options:
	    -1	 Show only the first match from all command line args, i.e.
		 displays a single path name if found (useful in makefile)
		 (-1 + -a for all first matches of command line args)
	    -u	 Unix style path names (use forward slashes as dir separators)
	- Minor refinements
