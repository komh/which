   MS-DOS and OS/2 `which' v2.1

   This is a clone of the Unix (csh) "which" command, used to locate
   executable commands in the user's PATH.  It has a few enhancements
   not in the Unix version:  it can print the locations of all copies 
   of the command(s), not just the one which will be executed; and it 
   can find DLLs in the LIBPATH and data files in the DPATH (these are
   probably OS/2-specific concepts anyway).

   The big improvement over the last major release (2.02) is the ability
   to detect 4DOS and 4OS2 aliases, in addition to more accurate detec-
   tion of 4* internal commands.  Thanks to Michael D. Lawler for the 
   spawnl() code on which this is based, for patches relating to Borland
   warning messages, and for some excellent beta testing.

   In addition, a 32-bit OS/2 executable (which32.exe) is now included in
   OS/2 distributions; it makes use of a 32-bit system call to determine
   the boot drive and therefore the location of the config.sys file (for
   determining the LIBPATH).  There is no 16-bit equivalent, so users of
   OS/2 1.x will have to make do with the original hit-or-miss method (i.e.,
   check the current drive, then drive c:).  Thanks to Kenneth Porter for
   sending the relevant code fragment.

   The which.exe executable which is included here is a bound executable
   compiled with MSC 6.0, able to run under any version of OS/2 or under
   MS-DOS.  It has been tested under OS/2 2.0 GA+SP (in windowed, full-
   screen and DOS sessions, and both CMD.EXE and 4OS2.EXE) and under
   4DOS.COM; previous versions were tested under OS/2 1.3 (CMD.EXE and
   DOS sessions) and MS-DOS 3.31 COMMAND.COM.
