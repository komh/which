  which32.exe   32-bit OS/2 2.x executable, compiled with emx+gcc 0.8f

The makefile has targets for most OS/2 compilers (not Zortech), thanks
to Kai Uwe Rommel's Info-ZIP efforts, but only the "msc", "mscos2", "gcc"
and "ibm" targets have been tested at all.  I'm not even sure all the switches 
are right for those... :-)  The "msc" target is the default, since it
results in a "universal" executable; however, the 32-bit targets (ibm,
gcc, watcom, etc.) result in a slightly more capable program.
